export const ABOUT_TEXT = `MOST POPULAR CAT ON X

The most popular cat name on X (formerly Twitter) — and in general right now — appears to be Luna.

From recent pet industry data (like reports from TrustedHousesitters, Rover.com, and others covering 2025 into 2026), Luna consistently ranks as the #1 cat name across the US and beyond.

It’s been holding the top spot for female cats (and often overall) for several years, inspired by its dreamy, moon-related vibe (Latin for "moon"), plus influences like Sailor Moon's black cat Luna.`;
