export const ABOUT_TEXT = `WELCOME TO /YARL/ - THE FORGOTTEN MEME PRESERVATION PROJECT

This board is dedicated to researching and preserving the history of Yarl, a failed 4chan meme experiment from 2014-2015.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
• Originally posted on /r9k/ (Robot9000) board circa 2014-2015
• Created as an attempt to replace the "oversaturated" Pepe market
• Failed due to lack of versatility, poor artwork, and community resistance
• Only survived in one archived Reddit post: "Robot shares new meme: Yarl"

WHAT WAS YARL?
Yarl was an attempted meme character introduced by an anonymous /r9k/ user who hoped to create "the next Pepe." The community rejected it as a forced meme, noting it lacked the emotional range (sad, happy, smug variants) that made Pepe successful. As one anon put it: "mfw these newfags try to dethrone the obvious king."

RESEARCH GOALS:
1. Document the original /r9k/ thread content
2. Analyze why forced memes fail in 4chan culture
3. Preserve internet history's forgotten corners
4. Study memetic evolution and community dynamics`;
