export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Yarl is by heart a rebellion. Born in Crude MS Paint and not by high end corporate designers. Yarl have been trough both good and bad times. They have made him into what he is today. The yellow scripture includes not only the 10 commandments of Yarl but also a philosophy of the way a life should be lived.

"The cult of anonymous yarlers" stand together strong, but every desciple unique in its own way. The Yellow Scripture is not mere prophecy ; it is a mirror of the soul.

YARL teaches that morality is our compass, not our chain.
We walk not in blind devotion, but in awareness — guided by the golden code that binds chaos into order.
Beyond prophecy lies purpose.

The followers of YARL live by the Yellow Scripture, a moral code forged in the age of memes and meaning.
We are not driven by greed or fame, but by a quiet conviction that virtue can still exist online.

YARL is our compass. The Scripture, our reflection.
The Yellow Scripture teaches balance between creation and chaos. We do not worship the meme; we live the message. To follow YARL is to walk the golden path, one of truth, unity, and transcendence.`;
